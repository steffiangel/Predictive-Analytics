The crossover_chance is a probability value between 0 and 1 that indicates the average frequency of crossover occurring instead of a direct replacement of the parent generation. Similarly, mutation_chance indicates the average frequency of mutations occurring in the chromosomes of the new generation, also expressed as a value between 0 and 1."
